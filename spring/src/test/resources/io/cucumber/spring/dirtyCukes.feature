Feature: Spring Dirty Cukes
  In order to have a completely clean system for each scenario
  As a purity activist
  I want each dirty scenario to have its own application context

  Scenario Outline: Eat some annotated dirty cukes
    Given there are 0 dirty cukes in my belly
    When I have <numberOfBeans> dirty cukes in my belly
    Then there are <numberOfBeans> dirty cukes in my belly

    Examples:
    | numberOfBeans |
    | 4             |
    | 2             |

  Scenario Outline: Eat some XML dirty beans
      Given there are 0 dirty beans in my belly
