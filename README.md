## Bugs and Feature requests

You can register bugs and feature requests in the 
[Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues). 

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by 
volunteers. If you do not provide the implementation yourself (or pay someone 
to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious bug, other 
people than you might care enough to provide a fix.
