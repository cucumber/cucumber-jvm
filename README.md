[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber) is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're
written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be
read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on
your team.

This is the Java implementation of Cucumber. You can [run](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#running-cucumber) it with
the tool of your choice - including with popular
[dependency injection containers](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/java/#dependency-injection).

volunteers. If you do not provide the implementation yourself (or pay someone
to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious bug, other
people than you might care enough to provide a fix.
