# cucumber-needle

Implements an ObjectFactory that creates instances of Glue and Steps Definitions via 
[needle](http://needle.spree.de). 
This allows easy configurable dependency injection without relying on a full blown DI 
container and automatic mocking of all not explicitly specified dependencies. 

See [needle tutorial](http://needle.spree.de/tutorial) for more information.
