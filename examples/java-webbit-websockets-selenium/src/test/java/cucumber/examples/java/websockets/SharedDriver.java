/**
 * <p>
 * Example of a WebDriver implementation that has delegates all methods to a static instance (REAL_DRIVER) that is only
 * created once for the duration of the JVM. The REAL_DRIVER is automatically closed when the JVM exits. This makes
 * scenarios a lot faster since opening and closing a browser for each scenario is pretty slow.
 * To prevent browser state from leaking between scenarios, cookies are automatically deleted before every scenario.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A new instance of SharedDriver is created for each Scenario and passed to yor Stepdef classes via Dependency Injection
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a bonus, screenshots are embedded into the report for each scenario. (This only works
 * if you're also using the HTML formatter).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A new instance of the SharedDriver is created for each Scenario and then passed to the Step Definition classes'
 * constructor. They all receive a reference to the same instance. However, the REAL_DRIVER is the same instance throughout
 * the life of the JVM.
