    By including the <code>cucumber-needle</code> jar
    on your <code>CLASSPATH</code> your Glue classes will be instantiated
    by <a href="http://needle.spree.de/overview">needle</a>.

    You can use the InjectionProviderInstanceSupplier and NeedleInjectionProvider to configure the behavior of the
    needle injection.
