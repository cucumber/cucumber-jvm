/**
 * Cucumber Guice configuration Api
 * <p>
 * An implentation of this interface is used to obtain an <code>com.google.inject.Injector</code> that is used to
 * provide instances of all the classes that are used to run the Cucumber tests. The injector should be configured with
 * a binding for <code>ScenarioScope</code>.
 * <p>
 * This module allows you to use Google Guice dependency injection in your Cucumber tests. Guice comes as standard with
 * singleton scope and 'no scope'. This module adds Cucumber scenario scope to the scopes available for use in your
 * test code. The rest of this documentation assumes you have at least a basic understanding of Guice. Please refer to
 * the Guice wiki if necessary, see <a href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation"

 * </p>
 * <h3>About scopes, injectors and migration from earlier versions</h3>
 * <p>
 * It's important to realise the differences in how this module functions when compared with earlier versions. The
 * changes are as follows.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Version 1.1.7 and earlier</h4>
 * <p>
 * A Guice injector is created at the start of each test scenario and is destroyed at the end of each test scenario.
 * There is no scenario scope, just singleton and 'no scope'.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Version 1.1.8 onwards</h4>
 * <p>
 * A Guice injector is created once before any tests are run and is destroyed after the last test has run. Before each
 * test scenario a new scenario scope is created. At the end of the test scenario the scenario scope is destroyed.
 * Singleton scope exists throughout all test scenarios.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Migrating to version 1.1.8 or later</h4>
 * <p>
 * Users wishing to migrate should replace <code>@Singleton</code> annotations with <code>@ScenarioScope</code>
 * annotations. Guice modules should also have their singleton bindings updated. All bindings in
 * <code>Scopes.SINGLETON</code> should be replaced with bindings in <code>CucumberScopes.SCENARIO</code>.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Using the module</h3>
 * <p>
 * By including the <code>cucumber-guice</code> jar on your <code>CLASSPATH</code> your Step Definitions will be
 * instantiated by Guice. There are two main modes of using the module: with scope annotations and with module
 * bindings. The two modes can also be mixed. When mixing modes it is important to realise that binding a class in a
 * scope in a module takes precedence if the same class is also bound using a scope annotation.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Scoping your step definitions</h3>
 * <p>
 * Usually you will want to bind your step definition classes in either scenario scope or in singleton scope. It is not
 * recommended to leave your step definition classes with no scope as it means that Cucumber will instantiate a new
 * instance of the class for each step within a scenario that uses that step definition.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Scenario scope</h3>
 * <p>
 * Cucumber will create exactly one instance of a class bound in scenario scope for each scenario in which it is used.
 * You should use scenario scope when you want to store state during a scenario but do not want the state to interfere
 * with subsequent scenarios.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Singleton scope</h3>
 * <p>
 * Cucumber will create just one instance of a class bound in singleton scope that will last for the lifetime of all
 * test scenarios in the test run. You should use singleton scope if your classes are stateless. You can also use
 * singleton scope when your classes contain state but with caution. You should be absolutely sure that a state change
 * in one scenario could not possibly influence the success or failure of a subsequent scenario. As an example of when
 * you might use a singleton, imagine you have an http client that is expensive to create. By holding a reference to
 * the client in a class bound in singleton scope you can reuse the client in multiple scenarios.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Using scope annotations</h3>
 * <p>
 * This is the easy route if you're new to Guice. To bind a class in scenario scope add the
 * <code>io.cucumber.guice.ScenarioScoped</code> annotation to the class definition. The class should have
 * a no-args constructor or one constructor that is annotated with <code>javax.inject.Inject</code>. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import cucumber.runtime.java.guice.ScenarioScoped;
 * import javax.inject.Inject;
 *
 * {@literal @}ScenarioScoped
 * public class ScenarioScopedSteps {
 *
 * private final Object someInjectedDependency;
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * public ScenarioScopedSteps(Object someInjectedDependency) {
 * this.someInjectedDependency = someInjectedDependency;
 * }
 *
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To bind a class in singleton scope add the <code>javax.inject.Singleton</code> annotation to the class definition.
 * One strategy for using stateless step definitions is to use providers to share stateful scenario scoped instances
 * between stateless singleton step definition instances. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import javax.inject.Inject;
 * import javax.inject.Singleton;
 *
 * {@literal @}Singleton
 * public class MyStatelessSteps {
 *
 * private final Provider&lt;MyStatefulObject&gt; providerMyStatefulObject;
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * public MyStatelessSteps(Provider&lt;MyStatefulObject&gt; providerMyStatefulObject) {
 * this.providerMyStatefulObject = providerMyStatefulObject;
 * }
 *
 * {@literal @}Given("^I have (\\d+) cukes in my belly$")
 * public void I_have_cukes_in_my_belly(int n) {
 * providerMyStatefulObject.get().iHaveCukesInMyBelly(n);
 * }
 *
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * There is an alternative explanation of using
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/InjectingProviders#providers-for-mixing-scopes" target="_parent">
 * providers for mixing scopes</a> on the Guice wiki.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Using module bindings</h3>
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to using annotations you may prefer to declare Guice bindings in a class that implements
 * <code>com.google.inject.Module</code>. To do this you should create a class that implements
 * <code>io.cucumber.guice.api.InjectorSource</code>. This gives you complete control over how you obtain a
 * Guice injector and it's Guice modules. The injector must provide a binding for
 * <code>io.cucumber.guice.ScenarioScope</code>. It should also provide a binding for the
 * <code>io.cucumber.guice.ScenarioScoped</code> annotation if your classes are using the annotation. The
 * easiest way to do this it to use <code>CucumberModules.createScenarioModule()</code>. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import com.google.inject.Guice;
 * import com.google.inject.Injector;
 * import com.google.inject.Stage;
 * import io.cucumber.guice.CucumberModules;
 * import io.cucumber.guice.InjectorSource;
 *
 * public class YourInjectorSource implements InjectorSource {
 *
 * {@literal @}Override
 * public Injector getInjector() {
 * return Guice.createInjector(Stage.PRODUCTION, CucumberModules.createScenarioModule(), new YourModule());
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Cucumber needs to know where to find the <code>io.cucumber.guice.api.InjectorSource</code> that it will use.
 * You should create a properties file called {@value io.cucumber.core.options.Constants#CUCUMBER_PROPERTIES_FILE_NAME}
 * and place it in the root of the classpath. The file should contain a single property key called
 * <code>guice.injector-source</code> with a value equal to the fully qualified name of the
 * <code>io.cucumber.guice.api.InjectorSource</code>. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * guice.injector-source=com.company.YourInjectorSource
 * </pre>
