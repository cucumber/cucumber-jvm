    <p>The HK2 module follows the patterns used by the Guice dependency module. An annotation binding scope named <code>@ScenarioScoped</code>
        has been added, which when set as the binding scope for a class, will limit the object's lifespan to the
        lifespan of a Cucumber scenario. I.e. a new instance of this object will be created for each Cucumber scenario.
    </p>
    <p>The ServiceLocator used by the module is provided by the user's implementation of ServiceLocatorSource. Expose
        your implementation to the Cucumber runtime by setting the environment key <code>hk2.locator-source</code> to
        the fully qualified name of the implementing class.
    </p>
    <p>The easiest way to do this is by creating a cucumber.properties file with the configuration values, and placing
        this file at the root of your classpath.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not provide your own custom ServiceLocatorSource, a default ServiceLocatorSource will be created by
        the module. This default ServiceLocator will be populated by services found in the <code>META-INF/hk2-locator/default</code>
        file.
