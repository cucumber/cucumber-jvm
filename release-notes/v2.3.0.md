Cucumber-JVM v2.3.0 has been released. This fixes the snapshot dependency in 
`cucumber-java8` along with the build process that caused the problem. 

Additionally Łukasz Suski provided a PR that reduced the tests execution of 
large test on Android 8.0 and below by approximately 50%!

For the full change log, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
