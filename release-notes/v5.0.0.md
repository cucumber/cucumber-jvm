Annotation based Configuration
------------------------------

Cucumber Expressions were originally introduced in Cucumber-JVM 3.0.0. With it
came the ability to register parameter- and data table-types by implementing the
`TypeRegistryConfigurer`. 

The `TypeRegistryConfigurer` however is not part of the glue. This made it
impossible to access the test context. With `cucumber-java` this is now possible
by using the `@ParameterType`, `@DataTableType` and `@DocStringType`
annotations. This allows parameter-, data table- and docstring types to be
mapped to objects which can only be created inside the test context.

For example in this scenario

```gherkin
Given the awesome catalog
When a user places the awestruck eels in his basket
Then you will be shocked at what happened next
```

We are now able to look up the _"awestruck eels"_ in the _"awesome"_ catalog as
part of the parameter transform.

```java
package com.example;

public class StepDefinitions {

    private final Catalog catalog; 
    private final Basket basket;
    
    @ParameterType("[a-z ]+")
    public Catalog catalog(String name) {
      return catalogs.findCatalogByName(name);
    }
    
    @ParameterType("[a-z ]+")
    public Product product(String name) {
      return catalog.findProductByName(name);
    }
    
    @Given("the {catalog} catalog")
    public void the_catalog(Catalog catalog){
      this.catalog = catalog;
    }
    
    @When("a user places the {product} in his basket")
    public void a_user_place_the_product_in_his_basket(Product product){
      basket.add(product);
    }
}
```

Note: The method name is used as the parameter name. A parameter name can also
be provided via the name property of `@ParameterType`.

Default Transformer
-------------------

It is now also possible to register default transformers using annotations.
Default transformers allow you to specify a transformer that will be used when
there is no data table or parameter type defined. This can be combined with an
object mapper like Jackson to quickly transform string representations into
objects.
 
The available default transformers are:
* `@DefaultParameterTransformer`
* `@DefaultDataTableEntryTransformer`
* `@DefaultDataTableCellTransformer`

Typically you'd use them all at once.

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JSR310Module;
import io.cucumber.java.DefaultDataTableCellTransformer;
import io.cucumber.java.DefaultDataTableEntryTransformer;
import io.cucumber.java.DefaultParameterTransformer;

import java.lang.reflect.Type;

public class DataTableSteps {

private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = 
   new ObjectMapper().registerModule(new JSR310Module());

    @DefaultParameterTransformer
    @DefaultDataTableEntryTransformer
    @DefaultDataTableCellTransformer
    public Object defaultTransformer(Object fromValue, Type toValueType) {
        JavaType javaType = objectMapper.constructType(toValueType);
        return objectMapper.convertValue(fromValue, javaType);
}
}
```

To facilitate the transformation of data table entries the table headers are
converted from title case to camel case and empty cells are represented by
`null` values rather then empty strings. So the following is now possible.

```gherkin
Scenario:  Some information isn't known yet
  Given some great authors
    | Full Name      | Born       | Died       | 
    | Terry Pratchet | 1948-04-28 | 2015-03-12 |
    | Neil Gaiman    | 1948-04-28 |            |
```

```java
package com.example;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Author {
   public String fullName;
   public LocalDate born;
   public LocalDate died;
}
```

```java
package com.example;

import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;

import java.util.List;

public class StepDefinitions {
    
    @Given("some great authors")
    public void some_authors(List<Author> authors){
       /*
        * authors = [
        *   Author(fullName="Terry Pratchet", born=1948-04-28, died=2015-03-12)
        *    Author(fullName="Neil Gaiman", born=1960-11-10, died=null),
        * ]
        */
    }
}
```

Empty cells in data tables
--------------------------

As mentioned in the previous sections. Empty cells in a data table are converted
to `null` values rather then the empty string. However there are use cases where
an empty string is actually desired. 

By declaring a table transformer with a replacement string it becomes‌
‌possible to explicitly disambiguate between the two cases. For‌
‌example:
‌
```gherkin
Given some authors
   | name            | first publication |
   | Aspiring Author |                   |
   | Ancient Author  | [blank]           |
```

```java
package com.example.app;

import io.cucumber.java.DataTableType;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;

import java.util.List;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @DataTableType(replaceWithEmptyString = "[blank]")
    public Author convert(Map<String, String> entry){
      return new Author(
         entry.get("name"),
         entry.get("first publication")
      );
    }
    
    @Given("some authors")
    public void given_some_authors(List<Author> authors){
      // authors = [Author(name="Aspiring Author", firstPublication=null), 
      //              Author(name="Ancient Author", firstPublication=)]
    }
}
```

Localization
------------

Some languages uses commas rather then points to separate decimals. To parse
these properly you'd have to use `TypeRegistryConfigurer.locale` to set this
globally. Cucumber will now use the language from the feature file unless a
locale is explicitly provided by the TypeRegistryConfigurer. This makes the
following work without additional configuration.

```gherkin
# language: fr
Fonctionnalité: Concombres fractionnaires

  Scénario: dans la ventre
    Étant donné j'ai 5,5 concombres fractionnaires
```

```java
package com.example.app;

import io.cucumber.java.fr.Étantdonné;

import java.util.List;

public class StepDefinitions {
    
    @Étantdonné("j'ai {bigdecimal} concombres fractionnaires")
    public void jAiConcombresFractionnaires(BigDecimal arg0) {
        assertThat(arg0, is(new BigDecimal("5.5")));
    }
}
```

DocString
---------

In addition to tables Gherkin supports doc strings.

```gherkin
Given some more information
  """json
  { 
     "produce": "Cucumbers",
     "weight": "5 Kilo", 
     "price": "1€/Kilo"
  }
  """
```

In Cucumber v4 these were treated as 1x1 data tables. Cucumber v5 introduces a
dedicated `DocString` object and type registry.

```java
package com.example;

import io.cucumber.docstring.DocString;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @Given("some more information")
    public void some_more_information(DocString docString){
        String content = docString.getContent(); // { "produce": "Cucumber" ....
        String contentType = docString.getContentType(); // json
    }
}
```

And using `@DocStringType` annotation it is possible to define transformations
to other object types.

```java
package com.example;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import io.cucumber.java.DocStringType;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @DocStringType
    public JsonNode json(String docString) throws IOException {
        return objectMapper.readTree(docString);
    }
        
    @Given("some more information")
    public void some_more_information(JsonNode json){
    
    }
}
```

Cucumber will first attempt to convert a doc string by looking for a doc string
type that matches the content type. If none is available then Cucumber will
attempt to use the parameter type of the annotated method.

Note: The method name is used as the content type. Content type can also be
provided via the contentType property of `@DocStringType`.
 
 
Property based options
----------------------

It is possible to pass properties to cucumber using CLI arguments in a property.

For instance:

```shell script
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options="--strict --monochrome"
```

This is rather complicated, esp when multiple shells are involved and the quotes
get confusing:

```shell script
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options='--strict --monochrome --tags "not @ignored"'
```

So a better way to do this is to provide each option individually:

```shell script
mvn clean test \
  -Dcucumber.execution.strict=true \
  -Dcucumber.ansi-colors.disabled=true \
  -Dcucumber.filter.tags="not @ignored"
```

A full list of properties can be found in: [Constants.java](../core/src/main/java/io/cucumber/core/options/Constants.java)
                                                            
Cucumber Expressions
--------------------

Cucumber-Expressions would originally try to guess if you wanted to use regular
of cucumber expressions. While helpful this also made it much harder to
understand if a particular string would be evaluated as a regular- or as a
cucumber expression.

From now on a regular expression is any string that starts with `^` and/or ends
with `$`. Everything else is considered a Cucumber Expression. This means that 
`"there is a (.*) step"` will no longer be seen as a regular expression. This
expression should be rewritten to `"there is a {} step"` or `"^there is a (.*) step$"`. 

Repeatable annotations
----------------------

All step definition annotations (@Given, @When, ect) are now repeatable.

```java
package com.example;

import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @Given("a step definition")
    @Given("another way to express the same thing")
    public void a_step_definition(){
    
    }
}
```

New package structure
---------------------

With the introduction of the module system in Java 9 it is no longer possible to
use the same package in different jar files. However different components of
Cucumber would use cucumber.api to mark their public API and Cucumber also
relied on split packages to detect extensions. 

The split packages have been removed after a significant refactoring. All
packages are now rooted in `io.cucumber.<module>` and `Backend` and
`ObjectFactory` implementations are loaded via SPI.

This was unfortunately a significant breaking change that affects both step
definition and the plugin APIs. The changes to the step definitions were already
introduced in version v4.5.0 to allow a graceful migration.

It was not possible to do the same with the plugin system. So plugins written
for Cucumber v4 will not work with Cucumber v5 but we have taken this as an
opportunity to use the JSR310 classes for timestamps and duration.

Public API
----------

Prior to v5 cucumber used the `cucumber.api` package to mark its public API.
This resulted in an a structure that exposed more implementation details then
strictly necessary. Replacing it with @API Guardian annotations allows for a
more encapsulated structure and a better defined API. A typical user of Cucumber
with dependencies on `cucumber-java`, `cucumber-junit`, and `cucumber-pico` will
now only need to import classes from
``` 
io.cucumber.java
io.cucumber.junit
io.cucumber.datatable
io.cucumber.docstring
```

Dependency changes
------------------

The refactoring also resulted in some changes in the dependency structure: 
`cucumber-java8` no longer depends on `cucumber-java`.

`cucumber-pico`, `cucumber-spring` and other DI modules no longer depend on
`cucumber-java`.

If you did not declare a dependency on `cucumber-java` you may have to add one
now. Finally the Plugin API was extracted to it's own module `cucumber-plugin`.

Custom plugin implementations will now only need to depend on this module rather
then all of Cucumber and its dependencies. Best used with scope `compileOnly`
(Maven) or `compileOnly` (Gradle). 

Removing timeout
----------------

It was possible to provide a timeout to step definitions. Unfortunately the
semantics are complicated. Cucumbers implementation would attempt to interrupt
the long running step but would not stop if the step was stuck indefinitely.

Additionally Cucumber would not consider a step failed if it did not terminate
within the given timeout. To remove the confusion and complexity we removed
timeout from Cucumber.

Consider replacing this functionality with the features provided by one of these
libraries instead:

* JUnit 5 `Assertions.assertTimeout*`
* Awaitility
* Guava TimeLimiter


Sharing the Spring Application Context
--------------------------------------

The `cucumber-spring` module provides dependency injection using the Spring
application context. The application context can take a long time to start up so
Springs `TestContextManager` framework will share identical application contexts
between tests. 

However to use step definitions Cucumber has to modify the application context.
When executing in parallel step definitions were registered concurrently and
this resulted in several race conditions. So as a workaround Cucumber would
create a new application context for each thread.

Some sleuthing by Dominic Adatia uncovered the root cause of the race
conditions and a solution to solve it properly. As an additional benefit
Cucumber will also share the application context with other unit tests
improving performance somewhat more.

Deprecating `--non-strict`
--------------------------

In most frameworks tests can either be skipped, failed, or succeed. In Cucumber,
they can also be pending or undefined. Tests that are skipped or succeeded do
not fail the build. But depending on your opinion of work-on-in-progress,
pending and undefined test might.

Cucumber facilitates provides the `--strict` and `--non-strict` execution options
which makes work in progress fail or pass respectively. This flexibility comes
at a cost. Tools that interpet Cucumbers output also have to be configured with
either the --strict or the --non-strict option and these configurations have to
be consistent.

While `--non-strict` has been the default for a long time we are now of the
opinion that work in progress is a failing state. This means that in proper TDD
fashion when given a feature file, it will not pass until all steps have been
implemented and made to pass (note: Cucumbers generated step definitions throw
a pending exception). To make this transition graceful Cucumber will log a
warning when using --non-strict. The warning can be suppressed by using
`--strict`. Eventually we'll remove the `--non-strict` option and make 
`--strict` the default behaviour.

JUnit 5 Support
---------------

Cucumber-JVM now has JUnit5 support. To use it add the
`cucumber-junit-platform-engine` dependency to your project. 
‌
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-junit-platform-engine</artifactId>
    <version>${cucumber.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

You can provide options by adding a `junit-platform.properties` file to your
classpath root. Below are the supported options.
‌
```properties
cucumber.ansi-colors.disabled=                          # true or false. default: true
cucumber.execution.dry-run=                             # true or false. default: false
cucumber.glue=                                          # comma separated package names. example: com.example.glue
cucumber.plugin=                                        # comma separated plugin strings. example: pretty, json:path/to/report.json
cucumber.object-factory=                                # object factory class name. example: com.example.MyObjectFactory
cucumber.snippet-type=                                  # underscore or camelcase. default: underscore
cucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=                    # true or false. default: false
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.strategy=            # dynamic, fixed or custom. default: dynamic
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=   # positive integer. example: 4
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.factor=      # positive double. default: 1.0
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.custom.class=        # class name. example: com.example.MyCustomParallelStrategy
```

Altogether your project should look like this.

### Tooling Support

So Cucumber has JUnit5 support. What does this actually mean and how do I run my
features? JUnit5 consists of three parts. The JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, 
and JUnit Vintage. The JUnit Platform is a framework to develop test engines.
Examples of these would be JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage. 

Cucumber implements the JUnit Platform API. Any one using Cucumber and the JUnit
Platform will be able to discover, filter and execute feature files as if they
were just another test. As Cucumber now implements a popular API it should be
easier to integrate with build systems and IDEs.

[JUnit5 consists of three parts]:   https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#overview-what-is-junit-5


### Running with the Console Launcher

The JUnit 5 project provides a `ConsoleLauncher`. You can use this to run
Cucumber. See the [JUnit5 documentation] for details. This will ouput something
like this.
‌
```

### Maven Surefire and Gradle

While Maven Surefire and Gradle support the JUnit Platform they do not yet use
it for test discovery<sup>[1],[2],[3]</sup>.  So a work around is needed. Add
this marker class to the package containing your feature files. Then run your
build system as you would normally
‌
```java
package com.example.app;

import io.cucumber.junit.platform.engine.Cucumber;

@Cucumber
public class RunCucumberTest {
}
```

‌Now your project should look like this:
‌
```
├─ pom.xml or build.gradle
├─ src/main/java/
|  └─ com/example/app/
|     └─ Application.java
├─ src/test/java/
|  └─ com/example/app/
|     ├─ ApplicationStepDefinitions.java
|     └─ RunCucumberTest.java
└─ src/test/resources/
   ├─ junit-platform.properties
   └─ com/example/app/
      └─ application.feature
```

### IDEA and Eclipse

IDEA and Eclipse have some support for the JUnit Platform<sup>[4]</sup>. Currently you 
can select package and run all features in it. It is not yet possible to select
single files or scenarios. This may become easier once support for file based
test engines improves<sup>[5]</sup>.
