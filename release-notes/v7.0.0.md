Cucumber-JVM v7.0.0
===================

Another year, another major version.

Below we'll discuss some notable changes in v7.0.0 As always the full change log
can be found in [the usual place](../CHANGELOG.md).

Cucumber Expressions v11
------------------------

Prior to v11 [Cucumber Expressions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/)
were transformed into regular expressions using a string substitution algorithm.
This algorithm had a number of edge cases.

Starting with v11 the Cucumber Expressions are described by
[their own grammar](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#grammar).
This fixes various ambiguities and bugs in the way Cucumber expressions are
parsed and transformed into regular expressions. This may however also break
Cucumber Expressions that depend on these ambiguities.

Before-All and After-All Hooks
------------------------------

The Cucumber-Java module now supports before-all and after-all hooks. This
closes one of the longest-open issues our issue tracker. 

The hooks have 'invoke around' semantics. All before-hooks will be executed
before any scenario is executed. After all scenarios have been executed all
after-hooks will be executed. 

```java
package io.cucumber.example;

import io.cucumber.java.AfterAll;
import io.cucumber.java.BeforeAll;

public class StepDefinitions {

    @BeforeAll
    public static void beforeAll() {
        // Runs before all scenarios
    }

    @AfterAll
    public static void afterAll() {
        // Runs after all scenarios
    }
}
```

JUnit 5.8 / JUnit Platform 1.8
------------------------------

The CucumberJUnit Platform Engine has been updated to 1.8. With JUnit 5.8 comes 
the `junit-platform-suite` engine. This engine allows the 
[programmatic declaration of test suites](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#test-suite).

So it is now possible to write the following JUnit 4 test:

```java
package com.example;

import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(glue = "com.example.application", features = "classpath:com/example/application")
public class RunCucumberTest {

}
```

As a declarative JUnit 5 test suite: 

```java
package com.example;

import org.junit.platform.suite.api.ConfigurationParameter;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.IncludeEngines;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectClasspathResource;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite;

import static io.cucumber.junit.platform.engine.Constants.GLUE_PROPERTY_NAME;

@Suite
@IncludeEngines("cucumber")
@SelectClasspathResource("com/example/application")
@ConfigurationParameter(key = GLUE_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "com.example.application")
public class RunCucumberTest {

}
```

In combination with the before-all and after-all hooks this allows for a
feature-complete migration from JUnit 4. 

Unfortunately Gradle and Surefire still only provide limited support for file
based tests. While Cucumber tests can be executed, the results are reported in
a `<Class Name> - <Method Name>` format. As a result only scenario names or
example numbers are reported. This can make for hard to read reports. 

By using `cucumber.junit-platform.naming-strategy=long` Cucumber will include
the feature name in the scenario name. This makes the test results legible.

e.g for Maven:

```pom.xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
    <configuration>
        <properties>
            <configurationParameters>
                cucumber.junit-platform.naming-strategy=long
            </configurationParameters>
        </properties>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```            
or for Gradle:

```build.gradle.kts
tasks.test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    systemProperty("cucumber.junit-platform.naming-strategy", "long")
}
```

Finally, the `@Cucumber` annotation has been deprecated in favour of `@Suite`.
The `@Cucumber` annotated class was originally intended as a workaround for
both JUnit 5's lack of suites and Gralde and Surefires inability to discover
non-class based. The with the introduction of the `junit-platform-suite` the 
`@Suite` annotation can do both.     

Bill of Materials
-----------------

It's a Bill of Materials (BOM) to help keep all dependencies aligned. 

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
            <artifactId>cucumber-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${cucumber.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<!--Then for example-->

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-junit-platform-engine</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```


Support for properties in testng.xml
------------------------------------

The `AbstractTestNGCucumberTests` will now pick up properties from `testng.xml`.
This allows the same runner to be reused in multiple suites. For example:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
<suite name="Example Suite">
	<parameter name="cucumber.filter.tags" value="@Gherkin and not @Zucchini" />

	<test name="Vegetable garden" preserve-order="true">
        <parameter name="cucumber.features" value="classpath:com/example/features/vegetable"/>
		<parameter name="cucumber.glue" value="com.example.vegetables.glue"/>
		<classes>
			<class name="com.example.RunCucumberTests"/>
		</classes>
	</test>

	<test name="Herb garden" preserve-order="true">
		<parameter name="cucumber.features" value="classpath:com/example/features/herbs"/>
		<parameter name="cucumber.glue" value="com.example.herbs.glue"/>
		<classes>
			<class name="com.example.RunCucumberTests"/>
		</classes>
	</test>
</suite>
```

DataTable API Changes
---------------------

Datatables can be transformed into lists, maps, lists of maps and other objects
using the `DataTable.asX` methods. However not all `asX` methods would use the
`@DataTableType` transformers that had been defined for them.

To avoid confusion all `DataTable.asX` methods now use a transformer. There are
however a few cases where a transform should not be used (such as inside an 
`@DataTableType` annotated method). So to retain the old behaviour:

 - Replace `DataTable.asList()` with -> `DataTable.values()`
 - Replace `DataTable.asLists()` with -> `DataTable.cells()`
 - Replace `DataTable.asMaps()` with -> `DataTable.entries()`

Strict mode and non-strict mode options have been removed
---------------------------------------------------------

Since v6 Cucumber has been executing scenarios in strict mode by default. This
means that pending and undefined steps will always fail the build. This ensures
that third party tools do not have to guess if pending and undefined steps
should fail a test run.

To make migration graceful the `--strict` and `--non-strict` CLI arguments and
`cucumber.execution.strict` property were left in place. These have now been
removed.


Cucumber-Java8 currently under consideration for deprecation
------------------------------------------------------------

Due to technical difficulties, the `cucumber-java8` module is currently
[under consideration for removal](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2174).
While [alternatives are explored](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2279),
you can already [migrate to `cucumber-java` annotation based step definitions automatically](https://github.com/timtebeek/cucumber-jvm-upgrades).
For now [Cucumber-Java8 is removed as recommendation](https://github.com/cucumber/docs/pull/783).
