Cucumber-JVM v2.0.1 has been released. The primary reason for this release is to fix two regressions in v2.0.0:

-   The method `Scenario.isFailed()`, that is available to hooks, does always return `false`.

-   The `--dry-run` option does not work, the steps are still executed.

For the full change log, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
