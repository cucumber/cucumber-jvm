## About to contribute?

We appreciate that. But before you do, please learn our basic rules:

* This is not a support or discussion forum. If you have a question, please ask
  it on [The Cukes Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/cukes).
* Do you have a feature request? Then don't expect it to be implemented unless
  you or someone else sends a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* Reporting a bug? We need to know what java/ruby/node.js etc. runtime you have,
  and what jar/gem/npm package versions you are using. Bugs with 
  [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) get
  fixed quicker. Some bugs may never be fixed.
* You have to tell us how to reproduce a bug. Bonus point for a 
  [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with a
  failing test that reproduces the bug.
* Want to paste some code or output? Put \`\`\` on a line above and below your 
  code/output. See 
  [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)'s 
  *Fenced Code Blocks* for details.
* We love [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), 
  but if you don't have a test to go with it we probably won't merge it.
* Before making significant contribution consider discussing the outline of 
  your solution first. This may avoid a duplication of efforts.

## Building Cucumber-JVM

Cucumber-JVM is built with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

```
mvn clean install
```

## IDE Setup

### IntelliJ IDEA

```
File -> Open Project -> path/to/cucumber-jvm/pom.xml
```

Your `.feature` files must be in a folder that IDEA recognises as *source* or 
*test*. You must also tell IDEA to copy your `.feature` files to your output 
directory:

```
Preferences -> Compiler -> Resource Patterns -> Add `;?*.feature`
```

If you are writing step definitions in a scripting language you must also add 
the appropriate file extension for that language as well.

### Eclipse

Just load the root `pom.xml`

## Contributing

To contribute to Cucumber-JVM you need a JDK, Maven and Git to get the code. You
also need to set your IDE/text editor to use:

* UTF-8 file encoding <sup>+</sup>
* LF (UNIX) line endings <sup>+</sup>
* No wildcard imports
* Curly brace on same line as block
* 4 Space indent (no tabs) <sup>+</sup>
  * Java
  * XML
* 2 Space indent (no tabs) <sup>+</sup>
  * Gherkin

`+` These are set automatically if you use an editor/IDE that supports 
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/#download).

Please do *not* add @author tags - this project embraces collective code 
ownership. If you want to know who wrote some code, look in git. When you are
done, send a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
If we get a pull request where an entire file is changed because of 
insignificant whitespace changes we cannot see what you have changed, and your
contribution might get rejected.
